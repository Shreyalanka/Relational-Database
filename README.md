# Relational Database Certification

### Overview
- **VS Code**: Set up and use Visual Studio Code for development.
- **PostgreSQL**: Learn to create and manage relational databases with PostgreSQL and SQL.
- **Linux/Unix Command Line**: Master Bash commands to navigate, script, and manage the file system.
- **Git**: Understand version control fundamentals, best practices, and collaboration workflows.

 ## 1. Bash Script Programs:
 > Bash scripts combine terminal commands and logic into programs that can execute or automate tasks

 ## 2. Bike Rental Shop Database:
 > It manages bike rentals and returns through a PostgreSQL database. 
 > Users choose from options to rent or return bikes. Renting involves selecting from available bikes, inputting a phone number to create or retrieve customer details, updating bike availability, and logging rentals. 
 > Returning a bike verifies customer identity, lists rentals, updates return dates, and marks bikes as available. 
 > The Linux shell Bash script ensures data integrity and guides users through menu-driven interactions, enhancing operational efficiency and customer service in the bike rental shop.

 ## 3. Celestial Bodies Database:
 > This PostgreSQL database outlines a structured schema for astronomical data, including tables for galaxies, moons, planets, quasars, and stars. Each table is defined with specific attributes such as names, types, identifiers, and relationships. Key features include constraints for data integrity, primary keys for unique identification, and foreign keys linking related tables. The data insertion statements populate tables with relevant astronomical information, facilitating comprehensive data management and analysis within the database.

 ## 4. Kitty Ipsum Translator:
 > In this project, Advanced Bash is used for scripting by converting whimsical "kitty ipsum" text into "doggy ipsum" text. This hands-on exercise involves using string manipulation, regular expressions, and shell functions, providing a deeper understanding of advanced Bash concepts and enhancing your scripting skills.

 ## 5. Number Guessing Game:
 > In this a Bash script runs a number guessing game in the terminal and saves user information in a PostgreSQL database. The 'Players' table tracks usernames, while the 'Games' table records game history. The game provides hints for each guess and identifies new and returning players, updating the database with each new game.

 ## 6. Periodic Table Database:
 > This project involves creating a comprehensive periodic table database managed through a Bash script. The script prepares the Git directory and shell script files and executes the scripts to fix and update the database. The database stores detailed information about elements, including atomic number, symbol, name, atomic mass, melting point, boiling point, and element type. The script retrieves and displays this information based on user input and updates the database with any necessary corrections.

 ## 7. Salon Appointment Scheduler:
 > This project interacts with a PostgreSQL database named 'salon' to facilitate appointment booking. It begins by presenting a list of services for selection and prompts users for their phone number. If the phone number isn't found in the database, it prompts for the customer's name and creates a new record. Once the service and customer details are confirmed, including appointment time, the script saves the appointment information in the database. This script streamlines the booking process and ensures accurate record-keeping for the salon's operations.

 ## 8. Student Database:
 > This PostgreSQL database dump includes tables for storing student, course, and major data. It manages student information like names, majors, and GPAs with operations for adding, updating, and querying. Courses and majors are also stored with operations for managing them. The schema includes a table linking majors and courses, enabling relationships between them. Primary keys enforce data uniqueness, and foreign keys maintain integrity across tables, supporting efficient data management for educational purposes.

 ## 9. World Cup Database:
 > The Bash script manages World Cup game data in a PostgreSQL database (worldcup or worldcuptest). It truncates existing data in games and teams, then reads game details from games.csv. For each game, it checks and inserts teams (WINNER and OPPONENT) into teams if they don't exist. It inserts game details (year, round, winner_id, opponent_id, winner_goals, opponent_goals) into games, ensuring data integrity and logging successful operations.
