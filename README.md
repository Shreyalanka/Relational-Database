 ## 1. Bash Script Programs:
 > Bash scripts combine terminal commands and logic into programs that can execute or automate tasks

 ## 2. Bike Rental Shop Database:
 > It manages bike rentals and returns through a PostgreSQL database. 
 > Users choose from options to rent or return bikes. Renting involves selecting from available bikes, inputting a phone number to create or retrieve customer details, updating bike availability, and logging rentals. 
 > Returning a bike verifies customer identity, lists rentals, updates return dates, and marks bikes as available. 
 > The Linux shell Bash script ensures data integrity and guides users through menu-driven interactions, enhancing operational efficiency and customer service in the bike rental shop.

 ## 3. Celestial Bodies Database:
 > This PostgreSQL database outlines a structured schema for astronomical data, including tables for galaxies, moons, planets, quasars, and stars. Each table is defined with specific attributes such as names, types, identifiers, and relationships. Key features include constraints for data integrity, primary keys for unique identification, and foreign keys linking related tables. The data insertion statements populate tables with relevant astronomical information, facilitating comprehensive data management and analysis within the database.
